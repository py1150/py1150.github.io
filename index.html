        <p>
	This blog post comprises analyses based on the stack overflow survey data 2017. In particular, two areas of investigation are focused on: A) Developer Types and B) factors 	 for career satisfaction of developers.  
	</p>
	<p>
          <h2>A: Developer Types</h2>
          In this section, it is explored whether developer types use different technologies and which salaries are typical for each developer type.
        </p>
	<p>
          <h3>Q1: Which technologies are used by which developer type?</h3>
          In order to find out which programming languages are typically used by different developer types, two categories, i.e., Data Scientist and Web Developer are analyzed. 	  The table below contains the results and indicates how many respondents are using the listed technologies.
	  <br>
	  <br>
            <table border="1" class="dataframe">
            <thead>
              <tr style="text-align: center;">
                <th></th>
                <th>Python</th>
                <th>R</th>
                <th>SQL</th>
                <th>Java</th>
                <th>Javascript</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <th>Data_Scientist</th>
                <td>0.3858</td>
                <td>0.1833</td>
                <td>0.4462</td>
                <td>0.5547</td>
                <td>0.4495</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>Web_Developer</th>
                <td>0.1788</td>
                <td>0.0984</td>
                <td>0.4594</td>
                <td>0.6881</td>
                <td>0.6285</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
	<br>
	From the results, it can be seen that the programming languages "Python" and "R" are 		typical instruments used by Data Scientists. It is used by 38.6% and 18.3% of Data 		Scientists respectively whereas corresponding values for Web Developers are half or less. 		The usage of SQL is equally distributed among the two groups. While around half of Data 	Scientists are familar with "Java" and "Javascript", these languages are clearly the 		domain of Web Developers as 60% or above of Web Developer respondents are familiar with 	these technologies. 	
        </p>

	<p>
          <h2>Q2: Developer Salaries</h2>
          In question 2 the relationship between occupation and salary is explored.
        </p>
	<p>
          <h3>Q2a: Average Salary</h3>
          If we investigate the average salaries and their distribution per developer type, we obtain the following image:
          <br>
          <img src="images/03_salary_dist_per_developer.png" width="80%" height="80%">
	  <br>
	  Average salaries do not strongly differ for Web, Desktop, Mobile Developers and Data Scientists. However, we can see differences in distributions, suggesting that for the career paths of Data Scientits and Mobile Developers, higher differences in salary values can be observed. Therefore, to further deep dive, the development of salaries for different levels of experience is explored for each career path below.
        </p>
	<p>
          <h3>Q2b: Salary Development </h3>
          The image below depicts the salary development over years of experience for different developer types. Increasing category numbers indicate increasing job experience.
          <br>
	  <img src="images/01_salary_ev_per_developer_bar.png">
	  <br>
	  As expected we see a clear upward development of salary for each career path as job experience is increasing.
	  More details can be seen in the box plot below which gives us the entire distribution of salary for each developer type.
          <img src="images/02_salary_evolution_per_developer.png" width="80%" height="80%">
	 <br> 
	 The data indicate that the strongest increase of average salary can be expected for Mobile Developers. However, in this category we also observe the strongest fluctuation of salary for each career stage.
	  <br>
	  The Data Scientist category also features a strong increase over experience categories. However, the distributions are narrower for this career path. Also, this career type show the highest average salary for the most experienced developers.
	  <br>
          Web and Desktop Developers occupy a middle position and show a stable evolution of salary. The most experienced categories do not render top salaries compared to other career paths. However, at the same time, entry level positions yield higher pay on average than for Mobile Developers. 
        </p>
        
          
         <p>
          <h2>B: Career Satisfication</h2>
	  In this section, it is investigated which factors determine career satisfaction of developers.
	  <br>
          The image below shows the correlations between potential factors with incluence on career satisfaction.
          <br>
          <img src="images/05_career_factors_corr.png" width="60%" height="60%">
	  <br>
          The correlations confirm that Job and Career Satisfaction are closely related. Job Satisfaction does not seem to render much additional insight. It is dropped from further analysis due to overlapping information. It is therefore dropped from further analysis. 
          <br>
	  By using the random forrest method, the importances of the factors are determined. The five most important are shown in the image below.
	<br>          
	<img src="images/06_imp_features.png" width="70%" height="70%">
	 <br>
          Salary, Stack Overflow Satisfaction and working hours are major factors of influence for career satisfaction. Also, job experience and job security are important. Higher salaries are associated with a greater career satisfaction. Also, more experienced developers feel more satisfied (as shown above, experience also means in turn higher salary).
	  Developers who are content users of stack overflow also tend to have higher career satisfaction. Increased job security renders a contribution to increased career satisfaction.
